# TigerOptimizer
A script that pulls grade distributions from Clemson's [Tiger Grader](http://clemson.urbad.net/courses) for easy schedule optimization!

*This was a project that is not being continued. As of Jan 2018, Clemson grade distributions are no longer released, making this program obsolete. You can still check past distributions of professors that are still teaching, so this isn't totally worthless!*

**Usage**

To use, run the script with the Department and Course # as arguments: 

```./ghd.sh CPSC 360```

**Output**

The 3 professors with the highest % A+Bs will be returned:

```

1. McKenzie, Kevin 82.5
2. Pargas, Roy P 78.3
3. Wang, Zijun 61.8
